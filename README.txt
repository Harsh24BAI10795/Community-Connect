INSTRUCTIONS TO MAKE THE "CONTACT ORGANIZATION" OR "CONTACT VOLUNTEER" BUTTON IN THE WEBPAGE TO WORK:-


The error occurs because your Windows 11 system doesn't have a default email application assigned to open and send emails for you.

IF YOU USE THE FILE IN YOUR MOBILE THE CONTACT ORGANIZATION BUTTON WORKS AS INTENDED AS MOBILES HAVE A DEFAULT MAIL APP ASSIGEND TO HANDLE THESE REQUESTS.



Setting Your Default Mail App in Windows 11:-

1. Open Settings: Click the Start button and then click on the Settings icon (it looks like a gear).

2. Go to Apps: In the left-hand navigation pane, select Apps.

3. Find Default Apps: Click on Default apps.

4. Set the Mailto Protocol:

5. In the search bar at the top, type mailto.

6. Click on the "MAILTO" entry that appears.

7. A list of installed applications will be shown. Select your preferred email app from the list, such as Mail, Outlook, or your web browser if you want to use a web-based client like Gmail or Yahoo Mail.

Once you have a default app set, close the settings window and try clicking the "Contact Organization" button again.


                                         THANK YOU
